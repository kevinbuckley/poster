      "tweet": "SPY options idea: bullish vertical - buy 670 strike call and sell 690 strike call, expiring Oct 17, 2025. Net debit, capped risk, and upside if SPY moves above the 670-690 area as earnings and rate cuts support markets.",
      "summary": "The plan uses a bull call spread on SPY with 670/690 strikes and Oct 17, 2025 expiry to capture upside with limited risk. Rationale: rate-cut optimism and resilient earnings could lift markets. Risks include premium outlay and IV spikes; monitor expiry dynamics.",
