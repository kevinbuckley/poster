    "summary": "Strategy: a defined-risk bull call spread on SPY with Sep 19, 2025 expiry. Buy SPY 660 call, sell SPY 680 call to cap cost.\n\nRationale: upside if SPY moves through 660 by expiration, aided by a potential Fed tilt and AI/computer-technology earnings. Risks: time decay and IV changes.",
