      "summary": "Recent action shows AI-led momentum lifting the S&P 500 and Nasdaq toward record levels, with the Dow showing more muted gains. This leadership from mega-cap tech and AI plays remains a primary driver. \n\nWhat to watch: rate paths, inflation signals, and ongoing earnings guidance will steer risk sentiment as markets reassess valuations. \n\nWeek ahead: the Fed meets Sep 16–17, with the SEP projections and policy tone closely watched; data on inflation and consumer demand will influence expectations for policy and markets.",

      "summary": "Idea: use a defined-risk bull call spread on SPY with near-term expiry to capture a rally toward the 660 area. \n\nTrade details: long 650 call + short 660 call, net debit about 3.31; break-even around 653.31; max profit about 6.69 if SPY closes at/above 660 at expiration. \n\nRisks and guidance: if SPY stays below 650, the maximum loss is the net debit; liquidity and spreads should be checked in the direct option chain and adjusted as needed based on price action and IV.",
