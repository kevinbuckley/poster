    "summary": "SPY trades near 657, with markets pricing in a late-September rate cut. A near-the-money 660 call expiring Sept 26 offers defined risk and potential upside if the rate rhetoric stays constructive.\n\nTrade setup targets a breakout above 660 with a relatively short time horizon; be mindful of time decay and headline risk from Fed comments.",
