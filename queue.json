      "summary": "Recent headlines point to the Nasdaq and S&P 500 pressing fresh highs as AI-driven momentum and easing inflation shape expectations for rate cuts. Investors are positioning for further policy support while watching earnings trends. \n\nIn the week ahead, traders will focus on the Fed policy decision on September 17, key inflation readings (CPI/PPI), and mega-cap reports that could sustain or recalibrate the rally.",

      "summary": "Option activity on SPY has shown a bullish tilt as rate-cut expectations persist and equities hold near record levels. Traders expect the upcoming data and Fed decision to drive further moves in SPY options. \n\nThe suggested approach is a bullish debit call spread: long the Oct 17, 2025 655 call and short the Oct 17, 2025 675 call. This caps risk to the net premium while offering upside if SPY advances past the higher strike by expiry.",
