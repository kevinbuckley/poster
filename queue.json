    "summary": "Overview: A Sep 19, 2025 SPY options spread is proposed, using a near-the-money long call and a slightly higher short call to create a defined-risk bet on upside.\n\nRationale: With the Fed meeting on the horizon (Sept 16â€“17) and expectations for rate cuts, a disciplined call spread can capture upside if equities rally, while capping losses to the net premium.\n\nRisks: Time decay and a potential pullback beyond the strike are possible; ensure liquidity and sizing fit your risk tolerance.",
